\section{Results II. Sample spectra}
\label{sec:results_sample}

Following the discussion of the vacuum ZLP analysis, we now
present the application of our machine learning strategy to parametrise the ZLP
arising in spectra recorded on specimens, specifically for
EELS measurements acquired in different regions
of the WS$_2$ nanoflowers presented in Sect.~\ref{sec:tmd}.
%
The resulting ZLP parametrisation will be applied to isolate the inelastic
contribution in each spectrum.
%
We will use these subtracted spectra first to determine the bandgap type and energy 
value from the behaviour of the onset region and second to identify excitonic
transitions at very low energy losses.

We start this section by presenting the training dataset, which consists of two groups of EEL spectra recorded
in thick and thin regions of the WS$_2$  nanoflowers respectively.
%
Then we discuss the subtraction procedure, the choice of hyper-parameters, and the error propagation
to the physical predictions.
%
The resulting subtracted spectra provide the information
required to extract the value and type of the bandgap
and to characterise excitonic transitions for different regions of these polytypic WS$_2$ nanostructures.


\subsection{Training dataset}
%

Low-magnification TEM images and the corresponding
spectral images of two representative regions of
the WS$_2$ nanoflowers, denoted as sample A and B  respectively, are displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:ws2positions}.
%
These spectral images have been recorded in the regions marked by a green square
in the associated TEM images, and contain an individual EEL spectrum in each pixel.
%
We indicate the specific locations where
EEL spectra have been recorded, including the in-vacuum measurements acquired
for calibration purposes.
%
Note that in sample B  the differences in contrast are related to the material
thickness, with higher contrast corresponding to thinner regions.

These two samples are characterised by rather different structural morphologies.
%
While sample A is a relatively thick region of WS$_2$, sample B corresponds to a region composed 
of thin petals, which is only one or a few monolayers thick. 
%
In other words, sample A is composed by bulk WS$_2$ while in sample B some specific regions
are much thinner, down to the few monolayers level.
%
This thickness information has been be determined
by means of the {\tt Digital~Micrograph} software.

One of the main goals of this study is demonstrating that our ZLP-subtraction method leads to
a satisfactory performance for spectra recorded with different microscopes and operating conditions.
%
With this motivation, the EELS measurements acquired on specimens A and B have
been obtained varying both the microscopes and their settings.
%
The TEM and EELS measurements acquired in specimen A  are based on a JEOL 2100F
microscope with a cold field-emission gun and equipped with an aberration corrector,
operated at 60 kV. A Gatan GIF Quantum energy filter was used for
the EELS analysis.
%
The corresponding measurements on specimen B were recorded instead
using a JEM ARM200F monochromated microscope operated at 60 kV, equipped with a GIF quantum ERS filter.
%
See Methods at the end of this work for more details.\\

In Table~\ref{table:sampledata} we collect the most relevant properties of the spectra collected
in the locations indicated in Fig.~\ref{fig:ws2positions} using the same format as
in Table~\ref{table:vacuumdata}.
%
Note that since the spectra from samples A and B
have been acquired with different microscopes, features of the ZLP
such as the FWHM are expected to be different.
%
From this table one can observe how the ZLP for the spectra acquired on sample A exhibit
a FWHM about five times larger as compared to those of sample B.
%
This difference in resolution can be understood from the fact that the EELS spectra from sample B, unlike those
from sample A, were recorded with a TEM equipped with a monochromator.

In the following we will present the results for spectra that are representative
for each of the two samples.
%
The full set of spectra is available together with {\tt EELSfitter},
the code used to produce the results of this analysis,
whose installation
and usage instructions are presented in Appendix~\ref{sec:installation}.

\subsection{Subtraction procedure}

Following the strategy presented in Sect.~\ref{sec:methodology}, again we combine
the N$_{sp}$ spectra recorded over each sample and we determine the 
experimental central values and uncertainties for the training points.
%
Next, we need to determine the choice for hyperparameters $\Delta E_I$ and $\Delta E_{II}$,
as we only want to train on data that is different from zero within uncertainties.
%
As explained in Sect.~\ref{sec:training}, we need the location of the first local minimum
on all the spectra to set a bound for $\Delta E_I$ and $\Delta E_{II}$. 
%
The representative plots can be observed in Fig.~\ref{fig:derivatives} and here it becomes
clear how much information is contained within the intensity derivatives of the spectra.
%
One can observe how the derivatives recorded in vacuum (for both specimens at locations
\#1, \#2 and \#3) are monotonically decreasing and slowly convergate to zero, whereas
the derivatives recorded on different regions of a sample behave very similar, capturing fluctuations
that are typical for the corresponding sample.

In Table~\ref{table:sampledata_summary} we have collected the mean value 
and uncertainty of the first local minimum, $\Delta E|_{\rm min}$,
averaged over the spectra corresponding to samples A and B from
Fig.~\ref{fig:ws2positions}.
%
From the uncertainties in $\Delta E|_{\rm min}$, we see that the
location of the first minimum is relatively stable
among all the spectra belonging to a given set.
%
This indicates that the onset of the inelastic contributions $I_{\rm inel}$ does
not change significantly as we move to different regions of the sample.
%
We also indicate
the corresponding values of the hyper-parameters
$\Delta E_{\rm I}$ and $\Delta E_{\rm II}$ defined in Fig.~\ref{fig:EELS_toy}.
%
Recall that only
the data points with $\Delta E \le \Delta E_{\rm I}$ is used for the training
of the neural network model.
%
For $\Delta E \ge \Delta E_{\rm II}$ instead, the training set includes only the pseudo-data
that implements the $I_{\rm ZLP}(\Delta E)\to 0$ constraint.
%
The values for $\Delta E_{\rm II}$ were determined from the vacuum recorded spectra
following the same procedure as explained 
in Sect.~\ref{sec:results_vacuum} and a plot similar to Fig.~\ref{fig:intensityratio} 
can be observed in  Fig.~\ref{fig:pdlocsample}, where we show the ratio between the central
experimental value of the vacuum EEL intensity and their corersponding uncertainty.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We note that the values of $\Delta E_{\rm II}$ for this part are significantly higher than
the ones found in Fig.~\ref{fig:intensityratio}. This could be ascribed to the fact that 
the vacuum spectra from sample A and B are recorded in proximity to a sample, and therefore
effects from the sample are still present, although at a reduced rate.\\

The model training is performed for a range of $\Delta E_{\rm I}$ values
subject to the condition that $\Delta E_{\rm I} \le \Delta E_{\rm min}$.
%
The optimal values of $\Delta E_{\rm I}$ listed in Table~\ref{table:sampledata_summary} are
determined as follows.
%
We evaluate the ratio
between the derivative of the intensity distribution acquired on the specimen over the
same quantity recorded in vacuum,
\be
\label{eq:rder}
\mathcal{R}^{(j)}_{\rm der}(\Delta E) \equiv
\la
\frac{
  dI_{\rm EEL}^{({\rm exp})(j)}(\Delta E)/ d\Delta E
}{
  dI_{\rm EEL}^{({\rm exp})(j')}(\Delta E) /d\Delta E
} \ra_{N_{\rm sp}' } \, ,
\ee
where $j'$ labels one of the $N_{\rm sp}'$ vacuum spectra and the average is taken
over all available values of $j'$.
%
This ratio allows to identify a suitable value of $\Delta E_{I}$ by establishing
for which energy losses the shape (rather than the absolute value) of the intensity distributions 
recorded on the specimen starts to differ significantly from their vacuum counterparts.
%
A sensible choice of $\Delta E_{\rm I}$ could for instance be given by
$\mathcal{R}_{\rm der}(\Delta E_{\rm I}) \simeq 0.9$, for which derivatives differ
at the 10\% level.
%
Note also that the value of the energy loss satisfying
$\mathcal{R}_{\rm der}(\Delta E)=0$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:rder}) corresponds to the position of the first
local minimum of the spectrum.

For both Sample A and B, the ratios calculated by means of Eq.~(\ref{eq:rder}) 
can be observed in Fig.~\ref{fig:rder} for two representative spectrum locations: 
we have used loc \#4 in both cases. Similar results are obtained for different
positions.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In specimen A it is straightforward to find that $\mathcal{R}_{\rm der}(\Delta E_I) \simeq 0.9$
at an energy loss of 1.8 eV. 
%
For specimen B,  $\mathcal{R}_{\rm der} \simeq 0.9$ at $\Delta E$=1.4 eV.
%
In this case however, the ratio first starts to increase before it decreases again. 
%
This happens consistently for all three vacuum spectra: the three individual ratios can hardly
be distinguished. 
%
It should be noted that the derivatives also differ at the 10\% level when 
$\mathcal{R}_{\rm der} \simeq 1.1$, which corresponds to $\Delta E$=1 eV.
%
Still, we use the point where $\mathcal{R}_{\rm der} \simeq 0.9$
for the determination of $\Delta E_{\rm I}$.
%
The reason to favor this choice over $\mathcal{R}_{\rm der}(\Delta E_I) \simeq 1.1$ is from 
the physical interpretation: after this point,
the derivative of the intensity distributions acquired on samples starts 
to approximate zero much faster than the derivatives in vacuum.
%
when the effect of the sample kicks in, the intensity profile should flatten or increase rather than
continue decreasing, which means the derivatives ratio should be {\it smaller} than unity. 
%
For this reason we choose $\Delta E_I$=1.4 eV as hyper-parameter for specimen B. 
Note that the validity of this choice will be checked later on.\\

Now that we have verified our choices of $\Delta E_I$ and $\Delta E_{II}$ for both samples,
we can move to the results of the training sessions. 
%
The end result of the neural network training is
 a set of $N_{\rm rep}=500$ replicas
  parametrising the ZLP, $I_{\rm ZLP}^{({\rm mod})(k)}(\Delta E)$.
 %
 Taking into account that we have $N_{\rm sp}$ individual spectra in each sample,  the ZLP
 subtraction is performed individually
 for each Monte Carlo replica,
 \be
 \label{eq:subtractedModelPrediction}
 I_{\rm inel}^{({\rm exp})(j,k)}(\Delta E) \equiv I_{\rm EELS}^{({\rm exp})(j)}(\Delta E) - I_{\rm ZLP}^{({\rm mod})(k)}(\Delta E)\, ,
 \quad \forall~N_{\rm rep} \, ,\quad j=1,\ldots,N_{\rm sp} \, ,
 \ee
 from which statistical estimators can be evaluated as usual.
 %
 For instance, the mean value for our model prediction for the $j$-th spectrum
 can be evaluated by averaging over the set of replicas,
 \be
 \la  I_{\rm inel}^{({\rm exp})({\rm (exp)}j)}\ra (\Delta E)
 = \frac{1}{N_{\rm rep}} \sum_{k=1}^{N_{\rm rep}}  I_{\rm inel}^{({\rm mod})(j,k)}(\Delta E) \, ,
 \quad j=1,\ldots,N_{\rm sp} \, ,
 \ee
 and likewise for the corresponding uncertainties or correlations.
%
 For large values of $\Delta E$
 the model prediction reduces to the original spectra, since in that region
 the ZLP contribution vanishes,
 \be
 I_{\rm inel}^{({\rm exp})(j,k)}(\Delta E \gg \Delta E_{\rm I}) \to  I_{\rm EEL}^{{\rm (exp)}(j)}(\Delta E) \, ,\quad
 \forall~j,k \, .
 \ee
 
 For very small values of the energy loss, the contribution to the total
 spectra from inelastic scatterings is negligible
 and thus the subtracted model prediction Eq.~(\ref{eq:subtractedModelPrediction}) should
 be zero. 
 %
 However, this will not be the case in practice since the neural-net model is trained on
 the $N_{\rm sp}$ ensemble of spectra, rather that just on individual ones, and thus the expected
 $\Delta E \to 0$ behaviour will only be achieved within uncertainties rather than at the level of
 central values.
 %
 Therefore, in the zero-loss regime the subtracted spectrum will not vanish completely.
 %
 To achieve the desired $\Delta E \to 0$ limit, we apply a matching procedure
 as follows.
 %
 We introduce another hyper-parameter, $\Delta E_0 < \Delta E_1$, such that
 one has for the $k$-th ZLP replica associated to the $j$-th spectrum the following
 behaviour:
 \bea
 \nonumber
 I_{\rm ZLP}^{({\rm mod})(j,k)}(\Delta E) &=& I_{\rm EELS}^{({\rm exp})(j)}(\Delta E) \, ,\quad \Delta E < \Delta E_0  \, ,\\
 I_{\rm ZLP}^{({\rm mod})(j,k)}(\Delta E) &=& I_{\rm EELS}^{{\rm (exp)}(j)} + \lp \xi_1^{(n_l)(k)}(\Delta E) -
 I_{\rm EELS}^{{\rm (exp)}(j)}(\Delta E)\rp  \times \mathcal{F} \, , \nonumber \quad 
 \Delta E_0 < \Delta E \le \Delta E_1 \, ,\\
 &&\mathcal{F} = \exp\lp -\frac{\lp \Delta E - \Delta E_1 \rp^2 }{\lp \Delta E_0 - \Delta E_1 \rp^2 \delta^2} \rp  \, , \label{eq:matching} \\
 I_{\rm ZLP}^{({\rm mod})(j,k)}(\Delta E) &=& \xi_1^{(n_l)(k)}(\Delta E) \, , \quad \Delta E > \Delta E_1 \nonumber \, .
 \eea
In Eq.~(\ref{eq:matching}), $\xi_1^{(n_l)(k)}$ indicates the output of the $k$-th neural network that parametrises
 the ZLP and $\delta$ is a dimensionless tunable parameter.
 %
This matching procedure might look complex at first sight, however it states just the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item For $\Delta E < \Delta E_0$, the modeled ZLP is exactly the same as the original spectrum;
\item Between $\Delta E_0$ and $\Delta E_1$, the transition sets in to the ZLP model prediction. $\mathcal{F}(\Delta E)$ represents a matching factor
 that ensures that the ZLP model prediction smoothly interpolates
 between $\Delta E=\Delta E_0$ (where $\mathcal{F}\ll 1$ and the original spectrum should
 be reproduced) and $\Delta E=\Delta E_1$
 (where $\mathcal{F}=1$ leaving the neural network output unaffected);
\item At energy loss higher dan $\Delta E_I$, the modeled ZLP is exactly the network prediction.
\end{itemize}

 %
 Here we adopt $\Delta E_0 = \Delta E_1 -0.5\,{\rm eV}$,  having verified
 that results are fairly independent of this choice.
 %
 Taking into account the matching procedure, we can slightly modify Eq.~(\ref{eq:subtractedModelPrediction})
 to 
 \be
 \label{eq:subtractedModelPrediction2}
 I_{\rm inel}^{({\rm mod})(j,k)}(\Delta E) \equiv I_{\rm EELS}^{({\rm exp})(j)}(\Delta E) - I_{\rm ZLP}^{({\rm mod})(j,k)}(\Delta E)\, ,
 \quad \forall~N_{\rm rep} \, ,\quad j=1,\ldots,N_{\rm sp} \, .
 \ee

 The ensemble of ZLP-subtracted spectra $\{I_{\rm inel}^{({\rm mod})(j,k)} \} $
 can then be used to estimate the bandgap of the specimen in the region where
 they were acquired.
 %
 Different approaches  have been put forward to estimate the value of the bandgap from 
subtracted EEL spectra, \textit{e.g.} by means of the inflection point of the rising intensity or
a linear fit to the maximum positive slope~\cite{Schamm:2003}.
%
Here we will adopt the approach of~\cite{Rafferty:2000} where the behaviour
of $I_{\rm inel}(\Delta E)$ in the onset region is modeled as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:I1}
    I_{\rm inel}(\Delta E) \simeq  A \lp \Delta E-E_{\rm BG} \rp^{b} \, , \quad \Delta E \ge E_{\rm BG} \, ,
\end{equation}
and vanishes for $E < E_{\rm BG}$, where both the bandgap value
$E_{\rm BG}$ as well as the parameters $A$ and $b$ are extracted from the fit.
%
The exponent $b$ is expected to be $b\simeq 1/2~(3/2)$ for a semiconductor material characterised
by a direct~(indirect) bandgap.
 %
 For each of the $N_{\rm sp}$ spectra and the $N_{\rm rep}$ replicas
 we fit to Eq.~(\ref{eq:subtractedModelPrediction2}) the model Eq.~(\ref{eq:I1})
 within a range taken to be
 $\lc \Delta E_{\rm I} - 0.5~{\rm eV}, \Delta E_{\rm I} + 0.7~{\rm eV}\rc$.
 %
 One ends up with $N_{\rm rep}$ values for
 the bandgap energy and fit exponent for each spectra,
 \be
 \Big \{ E_{\rm BG}^{(j,k)}, b^{(j,k)} \Big\} \, , \quad k=1,\ldots,N_{\rm rep} \, ,
 \quad j=1,\ldots,N_{\rm sp} \, ,
 \ee
 from which again one can readily evaluate their statistical estimators.
 %
 In the following, we will display the median and the 68\% confidence level intervals
 for these parameters to account for the fact that their distribution will be in general non-Gaussian.

 \subsection{Bandgap analysis of sample A}

We present first the results of the bandgap analysis of sample A,
taking location \#4 and \#5 in Fig.~\ref{fig:ws2positions} as representative spectra; 
compatible results are found for the rest of locations.
%
As mentioned above, this region is characterised by a sizable thickness where
WS$_2$ is expected to behave as a bulk material.
%
Fig.~\ref{fig:sp14_subtracted_spectrum} displays the original
and subtracted EEL spectra
together with the predictions of the ZLP model, where
the bands indicate the 68\% confidence level uncertainties and the central value
is the median of the distribution.
%
The inset shows the result of the polynomial fits using Eq.~(\ref{eq:I1}) to the subtracted spectrum
together with the corresponding uncertainty bands.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

One can observe how the ZLP model uncertainties are small at low $\Delta E$
(due to the matching condition) and large $\Delta E$ (where the ZLP vanishes),
but become significant in the intermediate region where the contributions
from $I_{\rm ZLP}$ and $I_{\rm inel}$ become comparable.
%
It is worth emphasizing that these (unavoidable) uncertainties are neglected in most
ZLP subtraction methods, and this is therefore the power of this method.
%
The validity of our choice for the hyperparameter $\Delta E_{\rm I}$ (Table~\ref{table:sampledata_summary})
can be verified {\it a posteriori} by evaluating the ratio
\be
\mathcal{R}^{(j)}_{\rm abs}\lp \Delta E_{\rm I}\rp \equiv 
\la I_{\rm ZLP}^{({\rm mod})(j)}\ra_{\rm rep} \Big/I_{\rm EEL}^{({\rm exp})(j)} \Big|_{\Delta E = \Delta E_{\rm I}} \, ,
\ee
which in this case turns out to be $\mathcal{R}_{\rm abs} = 0.98$.
%
It is important to verify that $\mathcal{R}_{\rm abs}\lp \Delta E_1\rp$ is not too far from unity,
indicating that the training dataset has not been contaminated by the inelastic contributions.
%
By requiring that $\mathcal{R}^{(j)}_{\rm der}(\Delta E_{\rm I})\simeq 0.9$ we obtain
the value $\Delta E_{\rm I}=1.8$ eV, which is used as baseline for the analysis.
%
It should be noted that this choice is not unique, for example requiring
$\mathcal{R}^{(j)}_{\rm der}(\Delta E_{\rm I})\simeq 0.8$ instead would have led
to $\Delta E_{\rm I}=2.0$ eV.
%
It is therefore important to asses the stability of our results when the hyper-parameter $\Delta E_{\rm I}$
is varied around its optimal value.

With this motivation, we have performed the training over the EEL spectra 
for a range of $\Delta E_{\rm I}$ values to assess the stability of our
results.
%
In Fig.~\ref{fig:bvalues_sampleA} we display the
values of the exponent $b$
and the bandgap energy $E_{\rm BG}$ 
obtained from spectrum \#4 (left panel in Fig.~\ref{fig:sp14_subtracted_spectrum})
for variations of $\Delta E_{\rm I}$ around its optimal value
(1.8 eV, indicated by the horizontal dashed line) by an amount
of $\pm 0.2$ eV.
%
The central value and the error band for each value of $\Delta E_I$ is evaluated
as the median and the 68\% CL interval over the $N_{\rm rep}=500$ Monte Carlo replicas.
%
We observe that the fit parameters for both $b$ and $E_{\rm BG}$ are stable with respect
to variations of $\Delta E_I$, with any shift in the central value contained within the
uncertainty bands.
%
We can therefore conclude that our approach is robust with respect to the choice of its
hyper-parameters.

    and the bandgap energy $E_{\rm BG}$ (right panel) from the model Eq.~(\ref{eq:I1})

    around its optimal value, indicated by the horizontal dashed line.
  }
\label{fig:bvalues_sampleA}
\end{centering}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


The final values for $E_{\rm BG}$ and $b$ obtained in the analysis for spectrum 4 and 5 are
\bea
E_{\rm BG}^{(4)} = 1.6_{-0.2}^{+0.3}\,{\rm eV} \, ,\quad b^{(4)} = 1.3_{-0.7}^{+0.3} (\#4)  \, ,\\
E_{\rm BG}^{(5)}  = 1.6_{-0.2}^{+0.2}\,{\rm eV} \, ,\quad b^{(5)} = 1.3_{-0.5}^{+0.3} (\#5) \, .
\eea
We thus find that for this specific region of the WS$_2$ nanoflowers
the model fit to the subtracted EEL spectrum exhibits a clear preference
for an indirect bandgap (where $b\simeq 1.5$), though a direct one ($b\simeq 0.5$)
cannot be excluded within uncertainties.
%
This result is consistent with the theoretical expectations of the local
electronic properties of bulk WS$_2$.
%
Further, the value of $E_{\rm BG}$ is consistent with previous determinations
in the same material at the bulk level, such as those collected in Table~\ref{table:bgvalues}.
%
Consistent results are obtained for other locations of Fig.~\ref{fig:ws2positions}
where spectra have been recorded. 
%
To demonstrate this, we show in Fig.~\ref{fig:bgstability} the fitted values 
for $E_{\rm BG}$ and $b$ for all spectra 
in Sample A, all evaluated using $\Delta E_I$=1.8 eV for the model training.
%
The uncertainty of the bandgap fit varies between the spectra, however
what is important is the fact that central values are stable within 
uncertainty bands.
%
This implies that we find a consistent favor for an indirect bandgap for each of
the locations on Sample A, which is what we would expect from 
theoretical expectations of bulk WS$_2$.
%
To the best of our knowledge
these results represent the first EELS bandgap analysis of WS$_2$ nanostructures
whose crystalline structure is based on mixed 2H/3R polytypes.

\subsection{Bandgap analysis of sample B}

We now discuss the results of the bandgap analysis of sample B,
taking location sp4 in Fig.~\ref{fig:ws2positions} as representative spectrum; compatible results
are found for the rest of locations.
%
In Fig.~\ref{fig:SubtractedEELS_plot_sp4} we present the analogous
result to that of Fig.~\ref{fig:sp14_subtracted_spectrum}.

Fig.~\ref{fig:subtracted_spectra_comp} displays the
the ZLP-subtracted spectra from sample B corresponding to locations sp4, sp5, and sp6
    from Fig.~\ref{fig:ws2positions} together with the corresponding model uncertainties.
    %
    Results are shown for two values of the hyperparameter $\Delta E_{\rm I}$,
    1.45 eV (left) and 1.55 eV (right panel).
    %
    Note how features of the subtracted spectra such as the peaks as $\Delta E\simeq 1.5$,
    1.7 and 2.0 are common across the three spectra, demonstrating that there
    are genuine physical features of the ultra-low-loss region rather than statistical
    fluctuations.
    %
The research on fundamental optical properties of TMDs has led to the discovery of different 
types of exciton transitions in the ultra-low-loss region of WS$_2$ nanostructures. 
%
The origin of these peaks can be attributed to the formation of an electron-hole pair mitigated
by the dielectric screening from the surrounding lattice~\cite{Hanbicki:2016}.
%
In reduced dimensions as in single layers of TMDs, exciton peaks arise with binding energies
up to ten times larger than for bulk structures.
%
In the optical spectra of TMDs, two strongly pronounced resonances denoted by A and B
excitons are often observed, appearing at binding energies of 300-500 meV below the true band gap~\cite{Karivaj:2019}.
%
This is in accordance with the features observed in Fig.~\ref{fig:subtracted_spectra_comp} at 
$\Delta E\simeq 1.5$ and 1.7 eV, which is exactly 300-500 meV below the true bandgap value
expected for 2D structures of WS$_2$. 
%
The presence of these low loss features makes the bandgap analysis on this sample 
non-trivial, since one can only fit Eq.~(\ref{eq:I1}) to the onset region of the 
bandgap excitation. 
%
Nevertheless, the ZLP-subtracted spectra in Fig.~\ref{fig:subtracted_spectra_comp} show that
we have been able to cleanly resolve exciton features down to 1.5 eV within appropriate
uncertainty.
